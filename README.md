# Consulars Origins

Consular's Origins is an add-on for the Origins mod. It adds several new origins to fit neatly with many different play styles.

This mod is completely open source. I really couldn't care less what you do with it.

Thanks to Apace100 for creating the original Origins mod.

This mod does require Pehkui and Origins to run properly.

# FAQ

Q: Will this mod be ported to Forge?

A: I currently have no intentions to port this mod over to Forge. It's not completely off the table, I just don't really feel like messing with that. You're welcome to port it over to Forge yourself if you want, as long as you credit me in some way.

Q: Will this mod be downgraded to 1.16.5?

A: No. The development of Origins addons has changed way too much between 1.16.5 and 1.17 for me to really care to do it. Again, if you want to do it yourself go for it. Just credit me.

Q: Can I suggest an origin?

A: Sure! I'd love to hear any suggestion you have for me.
